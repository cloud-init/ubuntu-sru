[Impact]
When deploying Bionic images with MAAS, the global dns configuration
was placed under physical devices; this meant some scenarios, like
a bridged interface did not get the correct DNS setting.

Cloud-init netplan rendering was updated to add the global DNS
settings to any interface that has network addresses but no
existing DNS setting, and not configured with DHCP.


[Test Case]
The basic idea below is:
 a.) launch an instance with proposed version of cloud-init.
 b.) inside instance, get cloud-init's network rendering tool from trunk
 c.) run the rendering tool against a config that failed before.
 d.) check rendered netplan config to verify it has the correct format.

## get render tool
$ wget https://git.launchpad.net/~cloud-init-dev/cloud-init/plain/tools/net-convert.py -O net-convert.py



## write the maas-bridge-dns.yaml version 2 network description
$ cat >maas-bridge-dns.yaml <<EOF
network:
    config:
    - type: physical
      id: eth0
      mac_address: b8:ae:ed:7d:16:d0
      mtu: 1500
      name: eth0
      subnets:
      -   type: manual
    - type: bridge
      bridge_interfaces:

      id: br0
      mac_address: b8:ae:ed:7d:16:d0
      mtu: 1500
      name: br0
      params:
        bridge_fd: 15
        bridge_stp: 0
      subnets:
      - type: static
        address: 10.90.90.4/24
        dns_nameservers: []
        gateway: 10.90.90.1

        - 10.90.90.1
      search:

## launch an instance and validate

   name=test-$release;
   echo "--- Start testing release=$release ---"
   lxc exec $name -- grep CODE /etc/os-release;

   done;
   echo "## RELEASE=$release Netplan content below:";
   lxc exec $name cat ./out.d/etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml;
   echo "## RELEASE+$release ENI content below:";
   lxc exec $name cat ./out.d/etc/network/interfaces;
   lxc exec $name -- dpkg-query --show cloud-init;
   echo "------------------"
done


[Regression Potential]

MAAS deployed Bionic images in situations where the interface was marked as
DHCP but the DHCP service in the machines network does not provide any DNS
values could no longer have any DNS.
