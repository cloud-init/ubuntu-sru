[Impact]
sudoers file now prefers '@' instead of '#' for includedir. Ensure we don't
break the sudoers file by adding an additional #includedir when
@includedir already exists.

[Test Case]
There is an upstream test for this bug:
https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/blob/master/tests/integration_tests/modules/test_users_groups.py::test_sudoers_includedir
