=== Begin SRU Template ===
[Impact]
When reading partition tables, prefer the partprobe command if it is available
rather than blkdev as blkdev is more fragile.

[Test Case]
There is an upstream test for this bug:

=== Focal ===

=== Groovy ===

=== Hirsute ===

[Regression Potential]
We fallback to blkdev if partprobe is unavailable, but a bug in implementation
could lead to partition tables being read incorrectly.
