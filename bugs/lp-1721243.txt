[Impact]

Systems running cloud-init with rootfs of type zfs will see a WARNING
message indicating that resizefs failed due to missing zpool commands.

Resolve this issue by adding additional checks in cloud-init to
prevent attempting to resize zfs-base root filesystems unless cloud-init
has access to /dev/zfs and the zpool command.

[Test Case]

To reproduce the failure, one needs a LXD with zfs storage backend
And the 18.2-0ubuntu1 package; the only package released with the issue.
The bionic cloud-image up to 20180404 still contains this package

% lxc storage create pool1 zfs
% lxc launch ubuntu-daily:bionic b1 -s pool1
% lxc exec b1 -- dpkg --list | grep cloud-init.*18.2-0ubuntu1
% lxc exec b1 -- /bin/bash -c cloud-init status --wait
% lxc file pull b1/var/log/cloud-init.log - | grep WARNING.*resizefs

If the package is broken, the last grep WARNING command will return
output like:

2018-04-06 15:23:24,182 - util.py[WARNING]: Running module resizefs (<module 'cloudinit.config.cc_resizefs' from '/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/cloudinit/config/cc_resizefs.py'>) failed

To test the newer package:

% lxc exec b1 -- sed -i 's/ bionic / bionic-proposed /' /etc/apt/sources.list
% lxc exec b1 -- apt update && apt install cloud-init
% lxc exec b1 -- dpkg --list | grep cloud-init.*18.2-4
% lxc exec b1 -- cloud-init clean --logs --reboot
% lxc exec b1 -- /bin/bash -c cloud-init status --wait
% lxc file pull b1/var/log/cloud-init.log - | grep WARNING.*resizefs


[Regression Potential]

Very low, only Bionic users since 2018-03-29 have had access to a cloud-init
with this capability and only LXD instances which could have a ZFS filesystem
would see the Warning; there are no Ubuntu cloud-images with ZFS root
filesystem so there is no user that could be dependent ubuntu the resizefs
working on a ZFS rootfs resize command.
