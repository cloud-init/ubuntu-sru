=== Begin SRU Template ===
[Impact]
An 'prefer_fqdn_over_hostname' config option was added to allow user control
of distro hostname selection if both short hostname and FQDN are supplied.
If `prefer_fqdn_over_hostname` is true the FQDN will be selected as
hostname; if false the hostname will be selectedA new config option was added

[Test Case]
There is an upstream test for this bug:
https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/blob/master/tests/integration_tests/modules/test_set_hostname.py::TestHostname

=== Bionic ===

=== Focal ===

=== Groovy ===

=== Hirsute ===

[Regression Potential]
A bug in implementation could cause hostname to be set incorrectly.
