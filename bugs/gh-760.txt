[Impact]
On Azure, with the changes for ssh public keys to be retrieved from IMDS as a first
option, when a key is passed through not in the raw ssh public key format it
causes an issue and the key is not added to the user's authorized_keys file.

[Test Case]
There is an upstream test for this bug:
