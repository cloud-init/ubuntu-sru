=== Begin SRU Template ===
[Impact]
ca_certs support was added for RHEL. This included a refactor of the code
affecting Ubuntu.

[Test Case]
There is an upstream test for this bug:
https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/blob/master/tests/integration_tests/modules/test_ca_certs.py

=== Xenial ===

=== Bionic ===

=== Focal ===

=== Groovy ===

[Regression Potential]
If a bug was introduced as part of the refactor, some aspect of writing or
linking ca-certs could no longer work.
