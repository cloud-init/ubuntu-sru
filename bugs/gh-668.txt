=== Begin SRU Template ===
[Impact]
When using ENI, route '-net' parameter is incompatible with /32 IPv4 networks
without 'netmask' part so we have to use '-host' in that case.

[Test Case]
There is an upstream test for this bug:
https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/blob/master/tests/integration_tests/bugs/test_gh668.py

=== Xenial ===

=== Bionic ===
n/a

=== Focal ===
n/a

=== Groovy ===
n/a

[Regression Potential]
This behavior will only affect Xenial. If somebody was relying on a
misconfigured network configuration, this will be a change in behavior.
