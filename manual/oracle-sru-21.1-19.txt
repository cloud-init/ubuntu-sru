# Test Case

Run `test_upgrade.py` with CLOUD_INIT_PLATFORM and CLOUD_INIT_OS_IMAGE set
appropriately.

# Results

The test artifacts can be found in the oracle-sru-21.1-19 subdirectory:
comparison indicates no regression between cloud-init versions.

Note that Oracle only has LTS images, so only results for those releases are
included.
